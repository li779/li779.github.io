We present the numerical tool DECaNT (Diffusion of Excitons in Carbon NanoTubes) that simulates exciton transport in thin films of carbon nanotubes. Through a mesh of nanotubes generated using the Bullet Physics C++ library, excitons move according to an ensemble Monte Carlo algorithm, with the scattering rates that account for tube chirality, orientation, and distance. We calculate the diffusion tensor from the position--position correlation functions and analyze its anisotropy and dependence on the film composition, morphology, and defect density.

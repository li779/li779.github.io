I am an incoming M.S. student in Robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I graduated with B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was guided by [Prof. Irena Knezevic](https://qtts.engr.wisc.edu/). My research interest was computational physics, a interdisciplinary field that applies scientific computing in solving applied physics problem.

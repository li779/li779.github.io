I am an incoming M.S. student in Robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I graduated from University of Wisconsin-Madison where I was guided by [Prof. Irena Knezevic](https://qtts.engr.wisc.edu/). My research focus was computational physics, an interdisciplinary field that applies scientific computing in solving applied physics problems. I am also interested in exploiting hardware capacity for scientific computing, such as parallel computing, cache optimization, sparse/dense matrix computation algorithm.

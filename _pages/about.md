I am an first-year MSR student in Robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I work under supervision of Prof. Wenzhen in [RoboTouch Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch/). My research interest is mainly simulation of tactile sensor with physics-based rendering.

I graduated from University of Wisconsin-Madison where I was guided by [Prof. Irena Knezevic](https://qtts.engr.wisc.edu/). My research focus was computational physics, an interdisciplinary field that applies scientific computing in solving applied physics problems. I am also interested in exploiting hardware capacity for scientific computing, such as parallel computing, cache optimization, sparse/dense matrix computation algorithm.
